# Conway's Game of Life

This game has been created by me for course purpose only. This is an amazing game.

This game created with JavaScript that will display an interactive animation based on one of the first and best known examples of cellular automaton, created in 1970 by British mathematician John Conway.  It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. The code created based on object oriented programming.

## The basic assumptions of the game:
* The Game of Life is a so-called *zero-player game* that develops on the basis of its original state.
* Cells arise and die on a two-dimensional board, and their state depends on their environment (eight cells which are their neighbors):
    * every live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies by underpopulation,
    * every live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation,
    * every live cell with more than three live neighbors dies by overpopulation,
    * every dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell again.
